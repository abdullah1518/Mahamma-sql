# Mahamma — مهمّة

A student freelance marketplace for KFUPM students to post tasks, offer services, and collaborate within the campus community.

## 🌐 Live Demo

| | URL |
|---|---|
| **Frontend** | https://mahamma.vercel.app |
| **Backend API** | https://mahamma.onrender.com/api |

> ⚠️ **Important note for graders:** The backend is hosted on Render's free tier, which automatically spins down after 15 minutes of inactivity. The **first request after a period of inactivity may take 20–30 seconds** while the server wakes up. Subsequent requests will be fast. Please wait briefly on first load before concluding something is broken. This is a known limitation of the free hosting tier and does not affect functionality.

## Demo Accounts

To test the platform without registering, use these pre-seeded accounts:

| Role | Email | Password |
|---|---|---|
| Client | `client@kfupm.edu.sa` | `client123` |
| Provider | `provider@kfupm.edu.sa` | `provider123` |
| Admin | `admin@kfupm.edu.sa` | `admin123` |

## Project Description

Mahamma connects KFUPM students as both clients and freelancers. Clients can post tasks, receive offers, compare them side-by-side, and track active jobs. Freelancers can list services, browse open tasks, submit proposals, and manage their earnings. Administrators can verify new users, moderate reported disputes, view analytics, and manage service categories.

The platform is built with a React frontend and a Node.js/Express/MongoDB backend exposing a fully documented RESTful API.

## Frontend Setup

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18 or later

### Steps

```bash
# Install frontend dependencies
npm install

# Start the Vite development server
npm run dev
```

### Test Accounts
You can log in to the application using any of the following seeded user accounts. All accounts use the password **`123456`**:
- `abdullah@kfupm.edu.sa` (Role: Client / Freelancer)
- `ayman@kfupm.edu.sa` (Role: Client / Freelancer)
- `anas@kfupm.edu.sa` (Role: Client / Freelancer)
- `mohammed@kfupm.edu.sa` (Role: Client / Freelancer)

The app will be available at `http://localhost:5173`.

For local development, the frontend defaults to `http://localhost:5000/api`.
For deployment, set this environment variable in the frontend hosting platform:

```env
VITE_API_URL=https://your-backend-domain.example.com/api
```

```bash
# Production build
npm run build
npm run preview
```

---

## Backend Setup

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18 or later
- A MongoDB Atlas cluster (or local MongoDB instance)

### 1. Create the environment file

Create a file named `.env` inside the `backend/` directory:

```env
PORT=5000
MONGO_URI=mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@<cluster>.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority
MONGO_DB_NAME=mahamma
JWT_SECRET=your_strong_secret_key_here
ALLOWED_ORIGINS=http://localhost:5173,https://mahamma.vercel.app
NODE_ENV=development
```

| Variable | Description |
|---|---|
| `PORT` | Port the Express server listens on (default: 5000) |
| `MONGO_URI` | Full MongoDB Atlas connection string |
| `MONGO_DB_NAME` | Database name inside the cluster |
| `JWT_SECRET` | Secret key used to sign JWT tokens |
| `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` | Comma-separated list of frontend origins allowed by CORS |
| `NODE_ENV` | Runtime environment, usually `development` locally and `production` on Render |

### 2. Install and run

```bash
cd backend
npm install

# Production
npm start

# Development (auto-restarts on file change)
npm run dev
```

The API will be available at `http://localhost:5000`.
